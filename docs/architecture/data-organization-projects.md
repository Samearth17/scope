# Data Organization: Projects

> **Status:** Proposed — design proposal. Date: 2026-06-30.

Scope currently stores all user-facing data in one flat, global namespace. This document
proposes a first-class way to **organize** that data **within a single Kubernetes cluster** by
introducing **the project** — a named container data is filed under.

This is the **data-organization layer** only: it defines the `projects` container, the `projectId`
field, and how data is **filed, filtered, and grouped** by it. **Access control — ownership,
membership, groups, visibility, and authorization — is out of scope and owned by
[auth-rbac.md](auth-rbac.md);** this design only populates the `projectId` field auth-rbac already
reserved, adding **no** permissions, roles, ownership, or enforcement and re-modelling **no**
existing data.

> **Landing order — independent of auth-rbac.** Because this layer adds only organization (a
> container + one field + filtering) and **no** access control, it can land **before, after, or
> alongside** auth-rbac with no dependency either way — `projectId` is simply inert until an access
> layer chooses to read it. See [Landing order](#landing-order-independent).

## Problem

All Scope data — runs (`requests`), profiles, criteria, prompts, personas, scenarios,
codebases, reports, insights, MCP servers — lives in **one shared, flat space** with no
organizing container. This is a **pressing, present-day pain** — not a future one — already
surfacing in user reports:

- Users can't find their own work (scope-core#677 _"How can I find back 'my' runs?"_,
  scope-core#766 _"Improve UX when listing all runs"_).
- There is no way to say _"these runs, profiles, and criteria belong together"_ (a scenario,
  an experiment, a team's workstream).
- Everything shares one namespace, so listings mix unrelated work together and there is no
  durable grouping to file work under.

auth-rbac.md governs **who can see and edit** each item (ownership + visibility). What it does
**not** provide is a **durable container** to file related work under and organize/filter by —
which is what this document adds.

**Crucially, findability is an _organization_ problem, not an _access_ problem.** Letting users
file and filter *their own* work needs no permissions, roles, ownership, or enforcement — only a
container and a filter. So this pressing pain can be addressed **now, on its own timeline**,
independent of the access-control work (see [Landing order](#landing-order-independent)).

### Goals

1. A **first-class organizing container** ("project") that gives data a durable home so related
   runs, profiles, criteria, etc. can be **filed together** and **filtered/grouped** as a unit,
   instead of floating in one flat namespace.
2. **Purely additive & non-breaking**: existing flat/global data keeps working unchanged; the
   feature is opt-in and reversible phase-by-phase.
3. **Clean composition with access control**: expose the `projectId` dimension that auth-rbac's
   access model can later key off — without this layer defining any ownership, membership, or
   enforcement itself.

### Non-goals

- **Access control — out of scope, owned by auth-rbac.** Ownership (`ownerId`/`ownerType`/
  `sharedWith`), **membership** (who belongs to a project), **groups/teams**, **visibility**
  (`private`/`shared`), permissions, roles, and the `readScope`/`writeScope` enforcement path are
  **all** defined by [auth-rbac.md](auth-rbac.md), not here. This layer neither adds nor changes
  any of them; it only adds the `projectId` organizing dimension they can compose with.
- **Cross-cutting tags/labels** — a companion organizing layer, specified in
  [data-tags.md](data-tags.md), not here. This doc covers only the project container.
- **Moving / re-filing entities between projects** — `projectId` is assigned once at creation and
  stays fixed; changing an entity's project is out of scope for this design.
- **Multi-cluster / cross-cluster** organization — explicitly out of scope. This is about
  organizing data *within a single cluster*.
- **Higher-level containers above the project** (a **workspace** grouping projects, an
  **organization** grouping workspaces) — out of scope. The project is the **single level of
  structure** here; such higher tiers are a natural additive future extension, discussed in
  [Alternatives considered](#alternatives-considered).
- **Code changes** — this document is a design proposal only. Schema/migration/route work is
  sequenced in [Phased rollout](#phased-rollout) for follow-up PRs.
- A new billing/quota/tenant-isolation boundary — projects are an *organizing* boundary, not a
  security or tenant boundary (tenant isolation stays with auth-rbac).

## Current state

Every user-facing collection is global and flat. Relevant collections today (see
[db.md](db.md)):

| Collection | Entity | Kind |
|------------|--------|------|
| `requests` | Runs (the core entity) | Durable |
| `profiles` / `profile-versions` | Run configuration profiles | Durable |
| `criteria` | Evaluation criteria (a DAG) | Durable |
| `task-prompts` | Content-addressed prompts (`task` / `agents.md`) | Content-addressed (immutable) |
| `mcp-servers` | MCP server configs | Durable |
| `codebases` / `codebase-revisions` | Source snapshots | Durable; revision `_id` is a fresh UUID (**not** content-addressed) |
| `reports` / `insights` | Judge output, derived from a run | Derived (follows parent) |
| `prompt-features` | Feature definitions (user-slug id); extractions embedded on `task-prompts` | Durable |
| `skills` / `skill-revisions` | Agent skills | Durable (skill) / deterministic derived-key id (revision) |

auth-rbac.md **reserves** (optional, ignored by its v1 logic) a `projectId?` field on entities,
plus a future `projects` collection keyed by Scope-owned ids, precisely so an organization layer
can slot in later. **This document is that layer**: it fills in `projectId` and introduces the
`projects` container. (auth-rbac's other reserved fields — `ownerType`, `groupId`, `sharedWith` —
belong to its access model and are **not** touched here.)

### Landing order (independent)

This design and auth-rbac are **orthogonal layers**. This layer adds only *organization* — a
container plus the `projectId` field plus filtering — and defines **no** identity, ownership,
visibility, or enforcement. So it has **no** dependency on auth-rbac in either direction, and
auth-rbac has none on it:

| Layer | Owned by | Needs caller identity? | Depends on the other? |
|-------|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Organization** (`projects`, `projectId`; filing, `groupBy:"project"`, active-project filter) | **This doc** | No — filing and filtering only *narrow* result sets | No |
| **Access** (ownership, membership, groups, visibility, `readScope`/`writeScope` enforcement) | **auth-rbac** | Yes | No — its access model **may** additionally key off `projectId`, but need not |

The only integration point is one-way and optional: **auth-rbac's `readScope` MAY read
`projectId`** (e.g. to make data discoverable to a project's members) once both layers exist. That
integration is specified in auth-rbac (Open Question B), **not** here. Until then the field is
inert — present and filterable, but unenforced. The [phased rollout](#phased-rollout) therefore
needs no identity layer for any of its phases.

---

## Recommended primitive

**The single organizing primitive is the Project** — a named container that data is *filed under*
and filtered/grouped by. It ships first and satisfies the "file related work together / stop mixing
everyone's data into one list" goal on its own, with no dependency on the access layer.

| Primitive | Job | First lands | Cardinality |
|-----------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| **Project** | Primary **organizing container**; the thing data is *filed under* and filtered/grouped by | **P1** | Each entity has **one** `projectId` |

Cross-cutting, many-to-many labelling (a run belonging to several efforts) is deliberately **not**
folded into the project — that keeps the singular `projectId` a scalar rather than an array (see
[Alternatives considered](#alternatives-considered)).

> **Groups / teams are deliberately not a primitive here.** A "team that owns a workstream" is an
> *access* concept (ownership + membership), which this layer leaves entirely to
> [auth-rbac.md](auth-rbac.md). A project is just a named bucket; *who* may see or administer it is
> auth-rbac's to decide. See [Non-goals](#non-goals).

### Why the Project

- **Project alone satisfies the core goal.** A single `projectId` gives every entity a durable
  home and makes "show me only this workstream" a one-clause filter — with **no** dependency on
  the access layer. It is the MVP that resolves the "find my work / stop mixing everything
  together" pain. This is the "start with one structure, phase the rest" spine of the
  [rollout](#phased-rollout).
- **Single `projectId` keeps everything cheap.** The reserved field is singular, so filing is one
  scalar write and filtering is one `{ projectId: { $in: […] } }` clause — no per-entity fan-out,
  no array-membership index gymnastics on Cosmos DB. It also hands the access layer a single scalar
  to key off later, should it choose to.
- **Organization ≠ access, so this layer stays small.** By leaving ownership, membership, groups,
  and visibility to auth-rbac, this design reduces to a container + one field + filtering —
  shippable in any order (see [Landing order](#landing-order-independent)).

Trade-offs and the rejected shapes (many-to-many projects, nested projects) are in
[Alternatives considered](#alternatives-considered).

## Data model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROJECT ||--o{ ENTITY : contains

    PROJECT {
        string _id "fresh UUID (Scope-owned)"
        string name "display name"
        string description "optional"
        bool   isDefault "true on exactly one (the seeded Default)"
        date   createdAt
        date   updatedAt
        date   deletedAt "soft delete"
    }
    ENTITY {
        string projectId "the project this entity is filed under"
    }
```

> The `projects` collection carries **no** owner or member fields, and there are **no**
> `project-memberships`, `groups`, or `group-memberships` collections. *Who* owns or may access a
> project is an [access concern owned by auth-rbac](#non-goals), not modelled here. `ENTITY` is any
> [project-scoped collection](#which-entities-are-project-scoped); auth-rbac separately adds its
> own `ownerId`/`visibility` fields to the same documents.

### New collection: `projects`

Mirrors the first-class-entity pattern established by `codebases` (fresh-UUID `_id`, timestamps,
soft-delete `deletedAt`) — minus any ownership field:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `_id` | `string` | Fresh Scope-owned UUID (no special-cased ids) |
| `name` | `string` | Display name |
| `isDefault?` | `boolean` | `true` on exactly one project — the seeded **Default** (the backfill target and resolution-order fallback); **absent** on all others (keeps the sparse index a single entry) |
| `description?` | `string` | |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` / `deletedAt?` | `Date` | Soft-delete like `codebases` |

There is intentionally **one** new collection. Ownership, membership, and group collections, if
ever needed, are introduced by [auth-rbac.md](auth-rbac.md), which owns access — not here.

### Fields added to existing entities

Every [project-scoped](#which-entities-are-project-scoped) entity gains a single field:

- `projectId?: string` — the project this entity is **filed under** (exactly one). Missing ⇒
  **coalesces to the Default project** (see [Migration](#migration)); after backfill every
  project-scoped doc carries one, so none is ever project-less.

For the immutable [deterministically-keyed](#deterministically-keyed-entities-per-project-copies)
copies, `projectId` comes with an identity change (below).

This design adds **nothing else** to existing documents. Access fields (`ownerId`, `visibility`, …)
are added separately by [auth-rbac.md](auth-rbac.md); the field sets are disjoint and independent (see
[Landing order](#landing-order-independent)).

### Which entities are project-scoped

The scoping boundary is deliberately **broad**: nearly all user-facing data is project-scoped, and
only platform infrastructure stays global.

- **Project-scoped, single-copy** (carry `projectId`): runs (`requests`), profiles, criteria,
  personas, scenarios, MCP servers, codebases, reports, insights, **skills**, **extensions**,
  **report templates**, **prompt features** (a per-project catalog keyed by a user-chosen slug — the
  slug becomes unique *within* a project, not globally), and **codebase revisions** (a fresh-UUID
  child that **inherits `projectId` from its parent codebase**). Prompt-feature *extractions* are not
  a standalone entity — they are embedded on the task prompt (`TaskPromptDocument.features`) and
  follow it.
- **Project-scoped, deterministically-keyed** (carry `projectId`): **`task-prompts` and
  `skill-revisions` only.** Their `_id` is a deterministic UUIDv5 (a pure function of the entity, so
  project-independent), meaning the same logical entity computed in two projects collides; scoping
  them means **each project keeps its own copy**. Full mechanics in
  [Deterministically-keyed entities](#deterministically-keyed-entities-per-project-copies).
- **Global platform catalog** (not project-scoped): **agents** and **models** — the platform-level
  registry of available coding agents and LLMs, shared by every project. Whether either ever needs
  project scoping (e.g. a project-private model endpoint) is an [open question](#open-questions).

### Deterministically-keyed entities: per-project copies

Two entities have a **deterministic `_id`** — a pure function of the entity rather than a random
UUID — so today one physical document is shared by every run that references it, deduplicating
cluster-wide:

- **`task-prompts` — content-addressed.** `_id = uuidv5(trimmed prompt text)`: the whole content is
  the key, so identical prompts collapse to one document.
- **`skill-revisions` — derived reference key.** `_id = uuidv5("{source}/{skillName}@{commitHash}")`:
  keyed by the version-pinned *ref* (the commit hash pins the version), **not** by hashing the
  revision's own bytes — so it is not content-addressed in the strict sense, but is equally
  deterministic.

In both cases the id is **project-independent**, so the same logical entity computed in two projects
would collide. (`codebase-revisions` are **not** deterministically keyed — their `_id` is a fresh
UUID keyed by `{codebaseId, revisionNumber}` — and `prompt-features` use a human-chosen slug; both
are ordinary [single-copy](#which-entities-are-project-scoped) project-scoped data, so the rest of
this section does not apply to them.)

Making them project-scoped means **each project keeps its own copy** — the same task prompt used in
two projects becomes two documents. This is the deliberate cost of strict project isolation (chosen
over a shared doc spanning multiple projects; see [Alternatives](#alternatives-considered)):

- **Identity becomes per-project.** `_id` can no longer be the bare deterministic UUIDv5 (it would
  collide across projects). Instead each copy takes a fresh `_id` with a **unique index on
  `{ projectId, keyId }`**, where `keyId` is the existing deterministic value (the content-addressed
  task-prompt id, or the skill-revision ref), retained as a field for equality/lookup **within** a
  project. *(A composite `_id` of `{projectId}:{keyId}` is an equivalent alternative.)*
- **Dedup narrows from cluster-wide to per-project.** Identical content is still deduplicated for
  runs **inside the same project**, but no longer across projects — write amplification grows with
  cross-project reuse of the same prompt text or skill revision.
- **Filed directly, not via a parent.** Each copy carries its own `projectId`, so these entities are
  filed and filtered like any other project-scoped data; the previous "reach through the parent run"
  indirection is gone.
- **Migration stays trivial.** At backfill time all data is in the single Default project, so each
  existing shared doc maps to exactly one project (Default) — no forking. Per-project copies only
  begin to diverge **after** migration, as the same content is reused inside newly created projects.

### Shape decisions

- **One project per entity — including copies.** An entity is filed under a single project;
  cross-cutting grouping is a separate concern, not multi-project
  filing. Deterministically-keyed entities preserve this invariant by keeping a
  [per-project copy](#deterministically-keyed-entities-per-project-copies) rather than one shared doc.
  (Multi-project filing is an [alternative considered](#alternatives-considered).)
- **Flat projects.** Nested/hierarchical projects (org → team → project) are deferred; a flat list
  covers the near-term need without path-scoping cost.
- **No owner/member fields.** A project is a bucket; its access model (owner, members, roles,
  visibility) is [auth-rbac's](#non-goals), added later without re-modelling anything here.

---

## Organization semantics

Projects are an **organizational**, not access-control, construct. They decide how data is
*filed and found*, never *who may see it* (that is [auth-rbac's](#non-goals)).

- **`projectId` files an entity under exactly one project.** It is set at creation from the
  caller's **active project** (below) and stays fixed — moving an entity between projects is
  [out of scope](#non-goals). Filing has no effect on who can see the entity.
- **The active-project context is always set and acts as a narrowing filter.** A caller always
  operates inside exactly one project; that project adds an `AND { projectId }` clause to list/read
  queries, so you see only that project's data. It can only show **less**, never more — it does not
  grant access to anything. There is **no** "all projects" / cleared state; to reach other data you
  **switch** the active project (one at a time).
- **Only platform infra is global.** `agents` and `models` are the sole global catalog — they have
  no `projectId` and appear the same in every project. Everything else (including the
  deterministically-keyed [per-project copies](#deterministically-keyed-entities-per-project-copies))
  carries a `projectId` and filters accordingly.

Because none of this is access control, **who can see across projects is entirely auth-rbac's
concern** — its `readScope` decides the visible set, and the always-set active-project filter only
narrows *within* it. See [Relationship to access control](#relationship-to-access-control-auth-rbac).

---

## Relationship to access control (auth-rbac)

**This layer defines no authorization.** It introduces no permissions, no roles, no membership,
and no changes to `readScope`/`writeScope`. All of that is owned by [auth-rbac.md](auth-rbac.md)
(see [Non-goals](#non-goals)). Concretely, this design does **not** add:

- `scope/project:*` (or `scope/group:*`) permissions, project-admin roles, or any role bundles;
- a `project` visibility tier, or any change to `private`/`shared`;
- any clause in the `readScope`/`writeScope` chokepoint.

The **one** forward hook it leaves for the access layer is the `projectId` field itself. If and
when auth-rbac wants project-scoped visibility (e.g. "data is discoverable to a project's
members"), its `readScope` **may** add a clause keyed on `projectId` — for example
`{ projectId: { $in: myProjects } }`. Whether to do that, how membership is defined, and what
visibility tiers exist are **auth-rbac's decisions** (its Open Question B), not this doc's.

Until then, `projectId` is an **unenforced organizing dimension**: present, indexed, and
filterable, but it never widens or restricts access on its own.

---

## Migration

**We create a Default project and file existing data into it — "unset" never means "global / no
project."** Every project-scoped entity is assigned to a **Default project** so today's listings
keep working. This mirrors the *shape* of how auth-rbac backfills legacy data, but requires none of
its fields.

- **Create + migrate (canonical).** Insert one **"Default"** project like any other (a fresh
  Scope-owned `_id`, `isDefault: true`), **capture its generated `_id`**, then **backfill that
  `_id`** as `projectId` onto all existing docs in the project-scoped collections. No id is
  special-cased — the Default is an ordinary project that happens to be seeded first and flagged
  `isDefault`. After it runs, every project-scoped entity physically carries a `projectId` — there is no null/global bucket. The
  Default project has **no** owner and **no** members (those are access concepts, out of scope); it
  is simply the bucket everything starts in.
- **Unset coalesces to Default (safety net, not a second meaning).** Reads/lookups treat a missing
  `projectId` as the **Default project's `_id`** — resolved once from the `isDefault` project and
  cached (`projectId ?? defaultProjectId`), not a hard-coded constant. This only covers the transient window
  between schema deploy and backfill completion (or a doc a batch misses), so nothing ever lands in
  a "global / no-project" limbo. Backfill is therefore an **indexing/filtering optimization**, not a
  correctness requirement.
- **Why it "keeps working."** This layer adds **no** enforcement, so filing data under Default
  changes *who can see what* not at all — every list simply gains a `projectId` it can now
  filter/group by. The active project defaults to **Default**, which holds all pre-existing data, so
  the first post-migration view is exactly today's list. Net: **behavior-preserving**.
- **Going forward**, new data lands in the caller's **active project**, which defaults to Default
  until they create or select another. Users can create projects and switch between them.
- **Landing order.** This Default backfill is **independent of** auth-rbac. It mirrors the *shape*
  of auth-rbac's legacy backfill but shares no field with it, so the two migrations can run in
  either order over the same data with no conflict.

Migration mechanics (`mongo-migrate-ts`, CosmosDB-RU constraints — see
[db-migrations.md](db-migrations.md)):

- A numbered migration creates the `projects` collection, inserts the Default project, and `$set`s
  `projectId` on scoped collections in **idempotent batches** (Cosmos RU-friendly; re-runnable).
  `down()` is log-only, per repo convention.
- Indexes (single-field + sparse + 2-field-for-sort, per the [CosmosDB skill](../../.agents/skills/cosmosdb-mongodb/SKILL.md) and app-design.md):

| Collection | Index | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `projects` | `{ isDefault: 1 }` sparse | Resolve the Default project (one cached lookup); exactly one doc carries it (seed migration + app invariant) |
| `projects` | `{ createdAt: -1 }`, `{ deletedAt: 1 }` | Newest-first list, active (non-deleted) filter |
| scoped entities (e.g. `requests`) | `{ projectId: 1 }` sparse | Project filter |
| scoped entities | `{ projectId: 1, _id: 1 }` | Project-scoped newest-first / cursor sort |

---

## Surfaces

Projects appear consistently in Portal, API, and CLI. Per the repo's **CLI↔Portal parity**
rule, every project capability in the Portal is also in the CLI.

### API

- **CRUD**: `GET/POST /api/v1/projects`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id` (soft-delete). No
  member/role routes — membership is an
  [access concern](#relationship-to-access-control-auth-rbac).
- **How the project reaches the API — an ambient header.** The active project is carried as a
  request header **`X-Scope-Project: <id>`**: **additive** (no existing route changes shape),
  cross-cutting (Portal/CLI set it once and it applies to every call), and keeping project *context*
  out of each resource's *address*. On **create**, the target `projectId` may instead be supplied in
  the request **body**. *(A future `?projectId=<id>` query-param override on list/read endpoints, for
  explicit deep-linkable requests, is a possible additive nicety — not part of the core design.)*
- **Not a URL path segment.** We deliberately do **not** nest routes under `/api/v1/projects/:id/…`.
  That would rewrite **every** existing route (a breaking change, contradicting the
  [non-breaking goal](#impact-on-existing-endpoints)) and conflate *context* with *identity* — an
  entity's `_id` is globally unique, so the project is scoping context, not part of its address.
  Point lookups stay at `…/:id` and remain [unscoped](#impact-on-existing-endpoints).
- **Resolution**: the header resolves through the
  [resolution order](#default-project-resolution-order), **always** yielding exactly one project
  (ultimately **Default**); list handlers AND-filter to it.
- **Runs list integration**: `projectId` becomes a categorical **filter** + **facet** dimension and
  a new `groupBy: "project"` value, composing with the existing server-side
  filter/facet/group/cursor pipeline (app-design.md "Runs List Query API") — no new query engine,
  just another dimension.
- Entities accept `projectId` on **create only** (immutable thereafter — moving is
  [out of scope](#non-goals)); responses include it so clients can show the project and offer
  filtering.

### Impact on existing endpoints

**Non-breaking, and invisible until projects are actually used.** No current route is renamed,
removed, or changes shape in a breaking way; every change is additive and phased — during **P0**
the API is byte-for-byte identical (only the schema field + backfill land). The
[resolution order](#default-project-resolution-order) guarantees that a request carrying no project
context resolves to **Default**, which after backfill holds all pre-existing data, so an unchanged
client sees exactly today's results.

| Endpoint class | Change | Backward compatibility |
|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| **List** — `GET /api/v1/{requests, profiles, criteria, codebases, reports, insights, mcp-servers, skills, extensions, task-prompts, prompt-features, report-templates}` | AND-filter by the resolved active project (`X-Scope-Project` header / resolution order) | No project context ⇒ Default ⇒ all legacy data ⇒ same list as today. Results only narrow once a user creates other projects and files data there. |
| **Runs list** — `GET /api/v1/requests` | `projectId` added as a **filter + facet + `groupBy:"project"`** value in the existing filter/facet/group/cursor pipeline (#1138) — no new query engine | All new params optional; omit them and behavior is unchanged. |
| **Create** — `POST /api/v1/…` | Accepts an optional `projectId`; when omitted, defaults to the active project (ultimately Default) | Old create calls keep working and land in Default. |
| **Point read/update/delete** — `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/…/:id` | Unchanged; responses gain an additive `projectId`. Point lookups stay **unscoped** — `_id` is a globally-unique UUID, so deep links and stored ids keep resolving | `projectId` is immutable, so update/delete never re-file. Enforcing project boundaries on point reads is an [access concern](#relationship-to-access-control-auth-rbac), not added here. |
| **Global catalog** — `GET /api/v1/agents`, `GET /api/v1/models` | **No change** — stay global platform infrastructure | Fully unaffected. |
| **Infra / config** — `system`, `feature-flags`, `secrets` | **No change** — not user content, outside this layer | Fully unaffected. |

Two cross-cutting notes: (1) responses across project-scoped resources gain an additive `projectId`
field and the OpenAPI spec is regenerated (field + `X-Scope-Project` header **added**; nothing
removed), so schema-strict clients keep validating. (2) The one **identity** change is for the two
[deterministically-keyed entities](#deterministically-keyed-entities-per-project-copies)
(`task-prompts`, `skill-revisions`): their `_id` moves from a bare deterministic id to a per-project
key, so an
internal lookup by that content id becomes project-scoped — called out in that section.

### Portal

- A **project switcher** in the app shell (top nav) sets and persists the active project; exactly
  one is **always** selected ([never a cleared "All projects" state](#organization-semantics)). Runs
  and catalog lists scope to it, shown as a context indicator (not a removable filter chip); other
  filters remain removable.
- Project management: **create / rename / describe / soft-delete** and list. (Members and roles are
  [out of scope](#non-goals) — added later by the access layer.)
- Project shown on list rows and detail pages.

### CLI

- `scope project list | create | use <id> | show`.
- Active project stored in CLI config (like `SCOPE_API_URL`); `--project <id>` per-command
  override; `SCOPE_PROJECT` env var. `scope run list` gains `--project` alongside its existing
  filters, keeping parity.

### Default-project resolution order

`X-Scope-Project` header (CLI: `--project` flag / `SCOPE_PROJECT` env) → configured active project →
the **Default** project (the one flagged `isDefault`). The most explicit signal wins, and the chain
**always** resolves to exactly one project.

---

## Phased rollout

The sequence deliberately **starts with the single Project structure** (P0–P1), so the core
organize-and-group goal ships as one additive layer. Each phase is independently shippable,
reversible, and non-breaking; earlier phases change **no** behavior because everything defaults into
the Default project and unset `projectId` is treated as Default.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P0["P0 Schema + Default<br/>+ backfill (invisible)"] --> P1["P1 Projects CRUD +<br/>active-project context +<br/>Runs projectId dimension"]
```

- **P0 — Schema + Default + backfill (invisible).** Add `projectId` (optional, ignored by
  logic); create the `projects` collection; create the Default project; backfill `projectId`. No
  behavior change.
- **P1 — Projects CRUD + context + Runs dimension.** `/api/v1/projects` CRUD; active-project context
  narrows lists; `projectId` as a Runs **filter/facet/`groupBy:"project"`**; Portal switcher + CLI
  `project` commands. Default is the initial active project ⇒ status quo preserved; new projects are
  opt-in.

## Open questions

Project-scoped **access** questions are deferred to auth-rbac **Open Question B**. The questions
that belong to *this* (organization) layer are:

- **Backfill target.** One global **Default** project for all legacy data (status-quo-preserving,
  **recommended**) vs per-user buckets (more separation, but reshuffles where legacy data shows up
  in listings). Recommendation: single Default for backfill.
- **Should the access layer key off `projectId`?** Whether project membership should drive
  visibility — and how membership is even defined — is **deferred to auth-rbac** (its Open
  Question B). This doc only guarantees `projectId` is present, indexed, and filterable.
- **Global platform catalog.** `agents` and `models` stay global platform infrastructure; confirm
  neither ever needs project scoping (e.g. a project-private custom model or agent endpoint).
- **Deterministic-id dedup cost.** Per-project copies of `task-prompts` and `skill-revisions` trade
  cluster-wide dedup for isolation; confirm the storage/write amplification is acceptable, or whether
  high-reuse content warrants a shared-with-`projectIds` exception. (Large codebase snapshots are
  **not** affected — `codebase-revisions` are single-project children of their codebase, never copied.)

## Alternatives considered

- **Tags as the only primitive (no container).** Cheapest to build, but a flat tag namespace gives
  no durable "home" to file work under and no default scope for new data — every list still mixes
  everything together until you remember to filter. Tags are kept as a **companion** cross-cutting
  layer ([data-tags.md](data-tags.md)), not the primary container.
- **Many-to-many project filing per entity.** More flexible ("this run is in three projects"), but
  turns the singular `projectId` into an array, complicates every filter and index, and blurs
  "which project this belongs to." Rejected; the cross-cutting need is met by
  [tags](data-tags.md) at far lower cost.
- **Shared deduplicated docs with a `projectIds` set.** Instead of copying the deterministically-keyed
  entities (`task-prompts`, `skill-revisions`) per project, keep **one** deduplicated document carrying the
  *set* of projects that reference it. Preserves cluster-wide dedup and storage efficiency, but a
  single physical doc then spans multiple projects — breaking strict project isolation and the "one
  project per entity" invariant, and muddying project deletion (when may the shared doc be
  reclaimed?). Rejected in favour of **per-project copies** for clean isolation (see
  [Deterministically-keyed entities](#deterministically-keyed-entities-per-project-copies)).
- **Nested / hierarchical projects.** Appealing for org → team → project, but adds path-scoping
  complexity and Cosmos query cost. Deferred — a flat list covers the near-term need, and hierarchy
  can be added later without re-modelling (a project could gain an optional `parentId`).
- **Higher-level containers (workspace → organization).** A tier *above* the project — a
  **workspace** grouping projects, an **organization** grouping workspaces — is a natural future
  extension, but out of scope here. Unlike nesting projects (above), it introduces **new container
  collections above `projects`** rather than making projects self-similar. It stays purely additive:
  projects gain an optional `workspaceId`, workspaces an `organizationId`, while entities keep
  carrying a single `projectId` unchanged. Starting with one level (the project) keeps the first
  cut small; the higher tiers are layered on only when a concrete need appears.
- **Reuse `submissionId` / the Experiment grouping (scope-project#54).** Those are
  **batch/reporting** groupings, not a durable container. Projects generalize *above* them: a
  submission or experiment lives *within* a project.
