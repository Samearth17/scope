/**
 * StuckRunReaper — authoritative backstop that fails runs permanently stuck
 * in `processing` after their worker died without writing a terminal state.
 *
 * Recovery of a lost `processing` run normally relies on Azure Storage Queue
 * at-least-once redelivery (the duplicate-message path in the queue-processor).
 * That trigger can be lost — e.g. a duplicate was dropped historically, or a
 * message expired (queue TTL) — leaving the run `processing` with no message
 * in existence. The `RequestScheduler` only dispatches `pending` runs, so such
 * a run is stuck forever. This reaper sweeps Mongo directly and is the only
 * recovery path that does not depend on a queue message surviving.
 *
 * Safety model (mirrors the redelivery handler in queue-processor.ts, but is
 * deliberately MORE conservative because it acts on a direct DB scan rather
 * than an at-least-once queue redelivery):
 *
 *   - Confirms Redis is reachable (`heartbeatStore.ping()`) before treating a
 *     missing heartbeat as a dead worker — a Redis blip must never mass-fail
 *     healthy runs. If the post-`mget` stale set is "everything" while Redis
 *     returned no heartbeats at all, a second ping re-confirms reachability
 *     (closing the ping→die→mget window).
 *   - Only considers runs whose `startedAt` is older than the staleness
 *     threshold (applied in-memory so the Mongo query stays on the indexed
 *     `run.status` equality and needs no `run.startedAt` range index on
 *     CosmosDB).
 *   - Two-strikes: a run must look stale in two *consecutive* sweeps before it
 *     is reaped. A transient Redis read blip (which makes the whole fleet look
 *     stale for one sweep) is absorbed because nothing was stale in the prior
 *     sweep; only genuinely-dead runs persist across both.
 *   - Confirmation re-read: immediately before failing a run, its heartbeat is
 *     re-read with a single-key GET. A fresh beat here aborts the reap
 *     regardless of why the batch read missed it (issue #1064).
 *   - Per-sweep circuit-breaker: if more runs would be reaped than
 *     `maxPerSweep`, the sweep is skipped and logged loudly — a correlated
 *     spike is almost certainly systemic (CosmosDB throttling, network) rather
 *     than N genuine worker deaths.
 *   - Atomic claim gated on the current `run.worker.instanceId`, so a peer
 *     takeover / retry between read and write makes the claim no-op.
 *   - Does NOT enqueue post-processing itself; it leaves `postProcessorStatus`
 *     unset so the existing PostProcessorDispatcher claims and enqueues it
 *     (avoids a set-status-then-send rollback hazard — the reaper has no queue
 *     client).
 *
 * A false positive (failing a still-alive, still-owning worker whose heartbeat
 * gapped past the threshold for two sweeps) is safe: the worker's terminal
 * writes are gated on `run.status: "processing"`, so once the reaper sets
 * `done` they no-op. The cost is a wasted in-flight run, never state corruption.
